## Objective
Discuss and navigate different data types in R
 - Vectors
 - Matrices
 - Arrays
 - Data frames

## Data Types in R
R treats objects differently based on their characteristics. For more information, please see: <https://www.statmethods.net/input/datatypes.html>.

-   **Vectors** 1 dimensional structure that contains elements of the same type.

-   **Matrices** 2 dimensional structure that contains elements of the same type.

-   **Arrays** Similar to matrices, but can have more than 2 dimensions. We will not delve into arrays in depth.

-   **Lists** Ordered collection of elements that can have different modes.

-   **Data Frames** 2 dimensional structure that is more general than a matrix. Columns can have different modes (e.g., numeric and factor). When we import csv files into the R workspace, they will enter as data frames.

## Vectors
### Creating Vectors
Add comments below that specify what kind of vectors are created. (First answer is provided.)

```{r Creating vectors}
# Vectors ----
vector1 <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4) # Vector type: Numeric
vector1
class(vector1)

vector2 <- c("one","two","three") # Vector type: Character
vector2
class(vector2)

vector3 <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) # Vector type: Logical
vector3
class(vector3)
```

### Vector Operations
Add comments below to indicate what each operation does.(First answer is provided.)

```{r Vector operatons}
# Returns the 3rd item in the vector
vector1[3]

#returns the maximum item in the vector
max(vector1)

#Create another vector of the values 10 thru 15
vector4 <- c(10:15)

#merges the two vectors together
c(vector1, vector4)

#multiplies the vectors together. first number x first number, second number x second number, etc.
vector1 * vector4

#multiplies each item in vector1 by the number 10
vector1 * 10

#makes each item uppercase
toupper(vector2) 

#prints each item's opposite value
!vector3

```

### Exercise 1a: Vector
Find a 5-day forecast of temperatures (Fahrenheit) for Durham, North Carolina. Create a vector representing the high temperature on each of the five days.
<https://www.wunderground.com/forecast/us/nc/durham/KNCDURHA138>

```{r Vector Exercise}

#Assign to the variable 'temps_F' a vector of high temperatures in F
temps_F <- c(80, 81, 81, 84, 83)

#What is the average of these temperatures 
mean(temps_F)

#Compute the difference between each temperature and the average calculated above
temps_diff <- temps_F - mean(temps_F)

#Subtract 32 and multiply by 5/9ths to create a vector in Celsius
temps_32 <- temps_F - 32
temps_C <- temps_32 * 5/9
temps_C

```

## Matrices
###Creating Matrices
Complete the comments below:
```{r Creating Matrices}
# Matrices ----
matrix1 <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 5,ncol = 4) # this makes a matrix that fills each item down each column
matrix1
#matrix1 has 5 rows and 4 columns

matrix2 <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 5, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE) #this makes a matrix that fills each item across each row
matrix2
#matrix2 has 5 rows and 4 columns

matrix3 <- matrix(
  data = 1:20, 
  nrow = 5, 
  ncol = 4, 
  byrow = TRUE, # return after comma continues the line
  dimnames = list(
    c("uno", "dos", "tres", "quatro", "cinco"),
    c("un", "deux", "trois", "quatre")
    )
  ) 
matrix3
#this makes a matrix and changes the names of the rows and columns. The first vector is for the row names. The second vector is for the column names.

```

### Matrix Operations
Add comments in the code chunk below to indicate type of vectors created and what each operation does.
```{r Matrix Operations}

matrix1[4, 1] #this prints out the item in matrix1 in row 4, column 1

matrix1[4,  ] #this prints out the items in matrix1 in row 4

matrix1[ , 3] #this prints out the items in matrix1 in column 3

matrix1[c(12, 14)] #this prints out the items in matrix1 that are in the 12th and 14th spot

matrix1[c(12:14)] #this prints out the items in matrix1 that are in the 12-14th spot

matrix1[2:4, 1:3] #this prints out the items in matrix1 that are in rows 2-4 AND columns 1-3

#Create a vector of 6 values
values = c(1, 26, 24, 68, 3, 44)
#Create a vector of row names
rnames <- c("R1", "R2") 
#Create a vector of column names
cnames <- c("C1", "C2", "C3") 

matrix4 <- matrix(
  data = values, 
  nrow = 2, 
  ncol = 3, 
  byrow = TRUE,
  dimnames = list(
    rnames, 
    cnames)
  ) # 

matrix4 #made a matrix that is 2x3 with special titles

matrix4['R2','C1'] #prints out the item in row 2 and column 1 
```

### Exercise 1b: Matrices
Compute the mean of column "C2" in matrix4. (Should be 14.5)
```{r Matrix Exercise}
mean(matrix4[ ,2])
```



## Lists
### Creating Lists
```{r Creating Lists}
# Lists ---- 
# Creating Lists
list1 <- list(
  name = "Maria", 
  mynumbers = vector1, 
  mymatrix = matrix1, 
  age = 5.3)
list1
```


### List Operations
```{r List Operations}
# List Operations

#prints out the whole list. name, numbers, matrix, and age.
list1

#prints out just the variable called age
list1$age

#prints out the name of the items in the list (not the items themselves)
names(list1)

#prints out the name and numbers
list1[1:2]

#changes the name from Maria to Janelle
list1$name = "Janelle"

#changes the age to 44
list1[[4]] = 44
```

## Data Frames
### Creating dataframes
```{r Creating data frames}
# Data Frames ----
#Create three vectors of equal length
d <- c(1, 2, 3, 4) # numerical vector
e <- c("red", "white", "red", NA) # character vector
f <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE) # logical vector

#Combine the vectors into a dataframe
dataframe1 <- data.frame(d,e,f) 

#Set the column names & View
names(dataframe1) <- c("ID","Color","Passed"); View(dataframe1) # 

#Add a new column to the dataframe
dataframe1$month <- c('Jan','Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr')

```


### Dataframe operations
```{r Dataframe Operations}
#Extract a column from the dataframe f
dataframe1$Color

#Extract a row
dataframe1[2,]

#Extract several rows
dataframe1[1:2,] 

#Extract a column
dataframe1[,1]

#Extract a column/columns from their name
out1 <- dataframe1['Color']; class(out1)
out1
out2 <- dataframe1$Color; class(out2)
out2
out3 <- dataframe1[c("ID","Passed")]; class(out3)
out3
```
